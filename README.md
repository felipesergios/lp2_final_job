# **Java final assignment**

## ðŸŽµ Java Music Streaming App

This project was developed as the final assignment for a university-level Java course, with the objective of applying key concepts of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** in a functional application.

The challenge was to design and implement a complete system using Java, demonstrating a solid understanding of the main pillars of OOP: **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, **polymorphism**, and **abstraction**.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The application simulates a **subscription-based music streaming service**, inspired by platforms like Spotify. The system includes basic but essential **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** operations, allowing users and administrators to interact with the platform.

---

### ðŸ“š Learning Goals

Practice and reinforce OOP concepts in a real-world inspired project

Build a modular and maintainable Java application

Understand how CRUD operations work in software systems
